# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Develop a classic Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript, where two players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid until one player gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. Use HTML for the layout and CSS for styling, while JavaScript handles the game logic, including checking for wins and handling player turns.
